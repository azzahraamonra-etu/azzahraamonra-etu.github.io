Objective: Automated KPI Monitoring with Gemini GCP and Power BI

Built an automated pipeline integrating Gemini (Google Cloud) APIs with Power BI to monitor weekly business metrics. The system:

Fetched data via Gemini API
Processed it using Python to compare this weekâ€™s vs last weekâ€™s metrics
Automatically color-coded metrics (Red: Drop, Yellow: Slight Change, Green: Improvement)
Pushed updated metrics into Power BI, enabling non-technical users to see KPI health at a glance âš™ Technologies Used: GCP Gemini API, Python (pandas), Power BI, Power BI Gateway, JSON/REST APIs
